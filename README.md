<!-- Lessons Learned -->

## Lessons Learned
This project was one of the best learning experiences I have had so far. Some of the things I learned:
- Tailwind Shades will take a color that you have (say you have a hex code) and it will create an array of shades for that color. In this project, Tailwind Shades was used to create the MUI theme of the application.
- Increased MUI skills
  - Explored how to create a custom theme globally to use throughout the app.
  - Learned how to pass a mode to the theme so that light and dark mode can be triggered (used the useContext hook for setting up the light/dark mode logic so that it can be accessed anywhere in the app)
  - useMediaQuery for writing styling logic in components
 - Data Grid provides easily customizable tables with a VAST amount of functionality
 - FullCalendar. The documentation is detailed and understandable.
 - Nivo charts - You can customize the charts right in the documentation and copy and paste the code into your project.
 - Formik + Yup : these tools were easier to use than React Hook.
